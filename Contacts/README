Contacts App
========================

This is a test app and has a number of known issues.  These include:

- Tests are not complete
- Single user is logged in automatically (no user auth)
- Needs more security scrutiny if it were going live
- Needs input validation
- Better error handling
- User input validation
- Not tested for mass-assignment hacks and other rails vulnerabilities
- Models are just a barebones minimum.  There would be a lot more data in a live app
- Could look and act a lot better with some UX design
