# Auto Dealership

## Background
An automotive dealership has approached us and is requesting us to create a tool to help them manage their inventory.
The dealership deals with different kinds of vehicles and has multiple locations they will transfer vehicles to and from.

## Your Task
Your task is to create a fully functional and tested Rails application named Dealership that accomplishes as many of the following user stories below as you can.
  You may use whatever database technology and testing framework
you feel is best and/or are most comfortable with.  You may use any gems to help you complete the stories.

## User Stories

1. As the dealer's owner, I need to be able to access a web page that allows me to add or remove locations for my company.

2. As the dealer's inventory manager, I need to be able to access a web page that allows me to add and remove vehicles.

3. As a salesman, I need to be able to access a web page that allows me to view the company's inventory.
  I should be able to view the make, model, price, location on this page.  When I click on the car, it should take me
  to another page that allows me to view more information about the vehicle.

4. As a salesman, I need to be able to mark a car as sold and log that I did it, and for how much.

5. As the dealer's inventory manager, I need to be able to access a web page that allows me to edit the location of a vehicle.
