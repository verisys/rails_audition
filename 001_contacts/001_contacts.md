# Contact Book

## Background
The department supervisors at your company would like to be able to have a single
location for the contact information of all employees in all departments for the 
company.

## Your Task
Your task is to create a fully functional and tested Rails application named Contact Book that accomplishes as many of the following user stories below as you can.
  You may use whatever database technology and testing framework
you feel is best and/or are most comfortable with.  You may use any gems to help you complete the stories.

## User Stories

2. As the department supervisor I would like to have a page that allows me to edit the previously entered information for a given contact.

3. As the department supervisor I would like to have a page that allows me to mark a contact as inactive.
