Briant Gale's rails audition

## Installing

First, clone the app, then use the following to get up and running:

```sh
cd autosapp
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rails server
```

## Getting started
I built this app with devise and different user roles.  For the purposes of testing, you can choose a user role when you sign up.  You should have access to different data based on the role selected to match the user stories.
